Project Information
    This is the feasibility prototype for Moon Eyes: Case Tracking System for Metro Detective Agency. 
    This was created as part of our Senior Design Project as a deliverable for the first semester. 

    Although not complete, this prototype utlizes the key technologies needed to complete the project by December 2023. 

    This prototype allows the user to log in, add cases/clients/subjects to the database, view details from their personalized dashboard, and edit cases.
    When submitting a new client/case/subject the user can attach their submission to existing cases/clients/subjects and vice versa utilizing the Select2 drop downs. 
    A user can also search the database for any entries.
    Aditionally, admin users can acess an admin controls dashboard where they can add a new agent(user with a login) and view case metrics.
